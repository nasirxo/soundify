# GitHub Repository Setup for Soundify

## Repository Information

### Repository Name
```
soundify
```

### Short Description (for GitHub)
```
üéµ Turn any file into sound! Convert files (.txt, .jpg, .png) to audible audio and decode them back - even after phone recording. Features Reed-Solomon error correction and 256-FSK modulation.
```

### Long Description
```
Soundify is a state-of-the-art C++ application that converts any file into audible sound waves and decodes it back to the original file - even after recording with a phone microphone! 

It uses Reed-Solomon forward error correction and 256-FSK modulation to create robust acoustic data transmission. Perfect for offline file sharing, educational projects, and creative data storage.

Key Features:
‚úì Supports any file format (.txt, .jpg, .png, .pdf, etc.)
‚úì Audible sound output (1-2.5 kHz range)
‚úì Works with phone recordings
‚úì Reed-Solomon error correction
‚úì CRC32 data integrity verification
‚úì Automatic filename/extension encoding
‚úì ~32 bytes/second transmission rate
```

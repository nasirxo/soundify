Hello, World!

This is a test file for the Audio Encoder/Decoder project.

The system can encode this text file into an audible WAV file,
and then decode it back to recover the original text - even 
after recording the audio with a phone microphone!

Features demonstrated:
✓ Text encoding
✓ Filename preservation
✓ Extension preservation
✓ Error correction
✓ CRC32 integrity checking

Try encoding this file:
  ./audio_encoder_decoder encode examples/test.txt output.wav

Then decode it:
  ./audio_encoder_decoder decode output.wav ./

You should get back this exact file as test.txt!
